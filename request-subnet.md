# Request a private subnet
{: #request-a-private-subnet}

In most deployments, the {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}} appliance is deployed in a reverse-proxy configuration. However, to configure the VPX with a forward-proxy configuration, Virtual IPs (VIPs) are needed, since the configuration will exist on a private network instead of a public one.
{: shortdesc}

You must open a support case with the IBM© Cloud support team and request that a private network for your {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}} appliance be added to your account. Note that you will require at least two private addresses, so you should request a private subnet size of at least /29.
