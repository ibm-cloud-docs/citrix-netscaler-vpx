# Request a private subnet
{: #request-a-private-subnet}

In most deployments, the {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}} appliance is deployed in a reverse-proxy configuration. However, to configure the VPX with a forward-proxy configuration, Virtual IP addresses (VIPs) are needed because the configuration exists on a private network instead of a public one.
{: shortdesc}

Open a Support case with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Support team and request that a private network for your {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}} appliance is added to your account. You require at least two private addresses, so request a private subnet size of at least /29.
