# Global load balancing with Citrix Netscaler VPX
{: #global-load-balancing-with-citrix-netscaler-vpx}

Global server load balancing (GSLB) is a mechanism to distribute traffic across multiple servers, typically residing in different geographical locations. A global balancing server receives traffic requests from clients and redirects them to a certain geography by using the criteria selected by the administrator.
{: shortdesc}

To achieve this, you can use the following method:

* **NetScaler VPX:** As with regular local load balancing, VPX uses a similar object hierarchy to load balance traffic between several geographies. Using DNS based global lookups, NetScaler chooses the respective record that corresponds to the site selected, the selection is based on the criteria pre-configured by the administrator. The incoming sections expand on this offering.

Other techniques are available for content distribution, such as HTTP redirection, that can also be implemented with the {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}}.

## About GSLB on VPX
{: #about-gslb-on-vpx}

NetScaler VPX can be enabled with GSLB simply by activating its feature on the CLI/GUI.

GSLB uses the same components as the ones used on local load balancing deployments, where entities are defined by using a hierarchical model.

GSLB might be implemented for several purposes:

* **Load distribution:** To distribute resources efficiently and smartly between multiple locations.
* **Disaster recovery:** Used when the main or primary location goes down or is unable to render the service. In this scenario, an alternate location can take over.
* **Performance shaping:** Allows you to position content closer to end systems, or in a way that enhances the service in question.

The main components or entities in the GSLB deployment are:

* **Virtual servers:** A VIP is an IP address to which clients send requests. NetScaler terminates the client connection at the VIP and then initiates a connection with a server that is configured in the (local) load balancing service.
* **DNS (Domain Name System) and Name servers:** Name resolution on GSLB works very much like regular DNS. The difference is the criteria used to determine the addresses resolved, GSLB uses a pre-configured load balancing method to handle this resolution. NetScaler can be configured to interact with DNS in different ways:
    * Authoritative DNS (ADNS). NetScalers by using ADNS mode are authoritative for a particular domain and all records on it.
    * DNS subdelegation. Occurs when a DNS server (authoritative of the domain) delegates the responsibility of a subdomain to a NetScaler system.
    * DNS proxy. When configured in this mode, NetScalers forward DNS requests to another server (external) handling the name resolution.
* **Method:** The method is an algorithm that the GSLB virtual server uses to select the best GSLB service from the topology. The algorithm assesses performance aspects that correspond to the actual selection criteria. The following methods are available:
    * Round Robin: Alternates incoming requests to be handled between the GSLB services regardless of their load.
    * Round Trip Time (RTT): A measure of time or delay between the client’s local DNS server and the (GSLB) sites. NetScaler uses different mechanisms such as ICMP echo request (PING), UDP, and TCP, to gather the RTT metrics.
    * Static Proximity: Uses an IP-address database to establish the proximity between the client’s local DNS server and the sites, then it uses it as criteria to make a selection.
    * Least Connections: Measures the least number of active connections on each service as selection criteria.
    * Least Response Time: Selects the site with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.
    * Least Bandwidth: Chooses the site that currently manages the least amount of traffic (Mbps).
    * Least Packets: Selects the service that receives the least number of packets in the last 14 seconds.
    * Source IP address Hash: Makes a selection of the service based on the hashed value of the client IPv4 or IPv6 address.
    * Custom Load: Selects a service that is not handling any active transactions. If all services in the load balancing setup are handling active transactions, the appliance selects the service with the smallest load (CPU usage, memory, and response time).

* **MEP (Metric Exchange Protocol):** A proprietary protocol that is used to exchange metrics (load and network) and persistence information between sites. MEP provides health checking between the different sites and NetScalers in the GSLB topology. Using the criteria set by the administrator, MEP provides a way for sites to communicate and handle the traffic based on the selection parameters previously configured. MEP uses TCP ports 3009 and 3011. When MEP is disabled, the selection of methods is limited to the options listed before marked with an asterisk (`*`). Any other method that is chosen reverts back to Round Robin.
* **Monitoring:** The NetScaler engine periodically evaluates the state of the remote GSLB services by using either MEP or explicit monitors bound to the services in question. Monitors are used just like on a regular load balancing service. In the case of GSLB, you do not need to add monitors to local services, as this is controlled by MEP.
* **Persistence:** A feature that establishes a site preference for a particular domain. In this particular use case, the traffic is not load balanced but handled by the same data center. This process can be helpful in certain applications, like e-commerce, where transactional data is unique to each a server.
* **GSLB site:** Sites can be defined as data centers or locations where a NetScaler system is configured/present. A NetScaler systems manages each GSLB site that is considered “local” to that site, while all other remote sites are seen and treated as “remote” sites.
* **GSLB service:** It is an object that represents (and is bound to) a (regular) virtual server or VIP. It can be either local (same site) or remote.
* **GSLB virtual server:** A GSLB virtual server is assigned to one or more GSLB services that are a part of different (GSLB) sites. Traffic that is received on it gets load balanced between the sites that are bound to it. The site selection is done based on the method and use case.
* **GSLB domain:** It represents the domain or zone for which the GSLB virtual server is responsible.
* **ADNS service:** A service that is represented by a combination of IP address and port, it is where DNS requests to a domain for which NetScaler is authoritative are sent. NetScaler takes those services to the GSLB virtual server bound to that domain in order to get a response.
