# Order an SSL certificate
{: #order-an-ssl-certificate}

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a technology that encrypts traffic between the client application and the server application. SSL is accomplished by using a public and private key system that uses an SSL certificate.
{: shortdesc}

SSL certificates contain the serverâ€™s public key, dates for which the certificate is valid, a hostname for which the certificate is valid, and a signature from the certificate authority that issued it.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} offers certificates that can be acquired and purchased without having to go through a third-party site.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offers yearly and bi-yearly SSL certificates for customers that offer various benefits, including:

* Full authentication for business identity and domain ownership verification
* 40- to 256-bit encryption on all online transactions
* Daily website malware scanning to ensure that both your site and your customers are protected

If you are running multiple domains, an SSL certificate can be purchased for each domain.

To order an SSL certificate for use with your {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}}, perform the following procedure:

1.	In VPX shell CLI, display the CSR text by opening the CSR file that is previously created in the step [Create keys and generate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR)](/docs/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-create-keys-and-generate-the-certificate-signing-request-csr-):

	```sh
	root@IBMADC690867-s6dr# cat certreqnss6dr.csr
	-----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

	-----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
	```

2.	Copy the content of the file starting with `---BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST---` all the way to `---END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST---`.

3.	Follow [these instructions](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-public-certificates&interface=ui) to place the order, pasting your CSR file text in the appropriate field. In the following example, `RapidSSL 1 Year` was chosen.

	As shown, the system processes and interprets the CSR text, then displays this in the following page.

	Make sure to select a valid email account and domain or subdomain, because this is the designated method to validate the ownership of the domain.

	Confirm your order details and click **Place Order**.

4. You receive an order confirmation with the details of the certificate request to the account you indicated.

	Click the link in the email to approve the domain validation request. At this point, the SSL request is ready to begin fulfillment.
