# Install your SSL certificate
{: #install-your-ssl-certificate}

You can install the SSL Certificate that you created in the previous step-by-step, [Deploying and Configuring the IBM© Hardware Security Module (HSM) with {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}}](/docs/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-deploying-and-configuring-the-ibm-hardware-security-module-hsm-with-citrix-netscaler-vpx) for your {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}}.
{: shortdesc}

To do so, perform the following procedure:

1.	Confirm that the certificate is present in the `/nsconfig/ssl` directory on your {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}}.

	```sh
	root@IBMADC690867-s6dr# cd /nsconfig/ssl
	root@IBMADC690867-s6dr# ls
	certbundle              ns-root.srl             ns-	sftrust-root.key     ns-sftrust.key
	hsmclient7.cer          ns-server.cert          ns-	sftrust-root.req     ns-sftrust.req
	ns-root.cert            ns-server.key           ns-	sftrust-root.srl     ns-sftrust.sig
	ns-root.key             ns-server.req           ns-	sftrust.cert
	ns-root.req             ns-sftrust-root.cert    ns-	sftrust.der
	```

2.	Even though the certificate key is located in the proper directory, it must be recognized as a valid {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}} object for it to connect and interact with other VPX components. To do so:

	```sh
	> add ssl hsmKey NSkey_s6dr -hsmType SAFENET -	SerialNum 534071053 -password P@rtition6
	ERROR:  Internal error while adding HSM key.
	```

	The previous command uses the following syntax:

	```sh
	add ssl hsmkey <KeyName> -hsmType SAFENET -serialNum 	<serial #> -password <password>
	```

	Where `keyName` is the name of the key that is created on the IBM© Hardware Security Module (HSM) with the CMU utility. The `serialNum` parameter is the serial number of the partition in question. The `password` parameter, as before, is the password of the partition on which the keys are present.

	The `Internal error` message is expected due to the increased time that it takes to complete this step. The key should be properly added. However, any other error messages you receive should be addressed.
    {: note}

3.	Confirm that the key was added:

	```sh
	> show ssl hsmkey
	1) HSM Key Name: NSkey_s6dr
 	Done
	```

4.	As with the HSM key, the SSL certificate must be added by using the appropriate Citrix VPX command for it to be recognized:

	```sh
	> add ssl certkey hsmclient7ns -cert /nsconfig/ssl/	hsmclient7.cer -hsmkey NSkey_s6dr
	Done
	```

	For the previous command the following syntax is used:

	```sh
	add ssl certkey <CertkeyName> -cert <cert path/name>
	-hsmkey <KeyName>
	```

	Where `certkey` is the name of the certificate object to be added in the VPX device. The `cert` parameter contains the name and path to the file, if it is located in a directory other than the current one. Lastly, `hsmkey` contains the name of the key added in the previous step.

5.	Confirm that the certificate was installed:

	```sh
	> show ssl certKey
