# Configuring and tuning SSL offload with Citrix Netscaler VPX
{: #configuring-and-tuning-ssl-offload-with-citrix-netscaler-vpx}

This step-by-step guides you through configuring and tuning SSL offload in {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}}, which is done by using the certificate and cryptographic material that is generated by using the Hardware Security Monitor (HSM) link.
{: shortdesc}

This step-by-step assumes that you have completed the steps in [Deploying and Configuring the IBMÂ© Hardware Security Module (HSM) with {{site.data.keyword.vpx_full}}](/docs/citrix-netscaler-vpx?topic=citrix-netscaler-vpx-deploying-and-configuring-the-ibm-hardware-security-module-hsm-with-citrix-netscaler-vpx) to order and create your VPX/HSM pairing.
{: note}

## About the deployment
{: #about-hsm-ssl}

This deployment was built and tested with the following component specifications:

| NetScaler VPX Version & Build	| HSM Software Version | HSM Firmware version | HSM Client Version |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| NS12.1: Build 48.13.nc | 6.2.2-5 | 6.10.9 | 6.2.2 |
