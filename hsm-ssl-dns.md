# Check and Configure the DNS Record
In this Step by Step example, the DNS service from IBM Cloud Internet Services is used to manage the DNS zone and its records. In this case, you must ensure a record is created for the FQDN being used. The record should point to the public address to be configured in the Citrix Netscaler VPX virtual server.

The static public IP to be used with the Citrix VPX can be retrieved from the Customer Portal by navigating to **Devices > Device List** and then selecting the name of your Citrix Netscaler VPX.
